The motionenergy/ directory is a course that is aimed at teaching students how Motion Energy Models work. We are the course maintainers and it is our job to ensure the material is comprehensive, accurate and focuses on teaching the students through intuition, foundations, and actively doing.

The [README.md](mdc:motionenergy/README.md) is the starting point for understanding the structure and purpose of the course. Always keep this global context in mind when you are building out features of the course.
