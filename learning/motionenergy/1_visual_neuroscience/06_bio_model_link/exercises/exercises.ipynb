    "In these exercises, you've implemented and tested various components that bridge biological visual processing with computational motion energy models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You created biologically-inspired filters that mimic different neural receptive field properties:\n",
    "   - Center-surround receptive fields (retina and LGN)\n",
    "   - Orientation-selective Gabor filters (V1 simple cells)\n",
    "   - Quadrature pairs for phase invariance (V1 complex cells)\n",
    "   - Spatiotemporal filters for direction selectivity (direction-selective V1 cells)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You compared your model outputs to known neural responses:\n",
    "   - Orientation tuning curves\n",
    "   - Phase invariance properties\n",
    "   - Direction selectivity indices\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You designed and optimized filters to match specific neural properties:\n",
    "   - Optimized Gabor parameters for V1 simple cells\n",
    "   - Created MT pattern cell models\n",
    "   - Designed a filter bank for motion energy computation\n",
    "\n",
    "These implementations will serve as a foundation for the complete motion energy model that you'll build in the next module. The biologically-inspired filters you've designed capture key aspects of neural processing in the visual system, allowing your computational model to better reflect how the brain processes motion information."
