# Visual Neuroscience: From Retina to V1

## Overview
This module explores how the visual system processes motion information, from the retina to higher visual areas. You'll learn about the neural mechanisms underlying motion perception and how they relate to computational models.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand how visual information is processed through the early visual pathways
- Characterize receptive fields of motion-sensitive neurons
- Differentiate between simple and complex cells in primary visual cortex
- Explain direction and orientation selectivity in visual neurons
- Connect neural mechanisms to computational principles in motion energy models
