# Motion Energy Models in Neuroscience - Course

## üìã Course Overview

This 30-day comprehensive course explores Motion Energy Models in the context of visual neuroscience. Students will gain deep intuition about both the mathematical foundations and computational implementations of these models, with a focus on how they relate to neural mechanisms of motion perception.

The course follows the structure outlined in the knowledge tree, progressing from mathematical foundations to advanced applications. Through a combination of theoretical explanations, interactive visualizations, and hands-on coding exercises, students will build a complete motion energy model and apply it to real-world problems.
