- I am building a course on Motion Energy Models in Computational Neuroscience. The second part focuses on visual neuroscience. For each subsection, I need to create both an overview.ipynb (teaching materials) and exercises.ipynb (coding exercises). The course should require students to implement most of the code while providing scaffolding and guidance. Content should build on the foundations from the previous section (0_foundations) and prepare students for the next section (2_motion_energy_model).
