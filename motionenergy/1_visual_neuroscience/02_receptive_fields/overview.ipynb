    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we explored center-surround receptive fields in the retina and LGN. These cells respond best to spots of light and are not selective for orientation. However, when we move to the primary visual cortex (V1), we find neurons with fundamentally different response properties.\n",

    "In the late 1950s and early 1960s, David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel conducted groundbreaking experiments recording from individual neurons in the visual cortex of cats. They discovered that V1 neurons respond most strongly to bars or edges with specific orientations in specific locations in the visual field.\n",

    "\n",
    "How do orientation-selective receptive fields emerge from center-surround inputs? Hubel and Wiesel proposed a simple feed-forward model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Multiple center-surround LGN cells with receptive fields arranged along a line provide input to a V1 cell\n",
    "2. When a bar of light with the correct orientation falls on these aligned LGN receptive fields, they all fire simultaneously\n",
    "3. The V1 cell integrates these inputs and fires, exhibiting orientation selectivity\n",

    "### Feature Extraction with Gabor Filters\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from the visualization above, Gabor filters act as feature detectors that extract oriented structures from the image. Each filter responds most strongly to edges or textures that match its orientation and spatial frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some key observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Orientation Selectivity**: Each filter responds strongly to edges aligned with its orientation and weakly to edges with perpendicular orientations\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scale Selectivity**: Filters with different wavelengths (scales) detect features at different resolutions\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Edge Enhancement**: The filters highlight edges and boundaries in the image while suppressing uniform regions\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Directional Information**: The filters extract information about the directionality of features in the image\n",
    "\n",
    "These properties make Gabor filters extremely effective at extracting meaningful features from natural scenes, which is why they serve as good models for V1 receptive fields and are also widely used in computer vision applications."
