# Motion Energy Models in Neuroscience - Course Overview

## Course Description
This 30-day comprehensive tutorial-based course explores Motion Energy Models in the context of visual neuroscience. Students will gain deep intuition about both the mathematical foundations and computational implementations of these models, with a focus on how they relate to neural mechanisms of motion perception.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. Understand and visualize motion in the spatiotemporal domain
2. Implement spatial and temporal filters for motion detection
3. Build a complete motion energy model from scratch
4. Connect computational models to neurobiological mechanisms
5. Compare motion energy models with other approaches in the field
6. Apply motion energy models to practical problems

## Structure
The course is divided into four modules corresponding to the 4-week schedule:

1. **Foundations: Visualizing Motion & Math Tools** (Week 1)
   - Building mathematical intuition for motion representation
   - Understanding filtering and signal processing fundamentals

2. **Visual Neuroscience: From Retina to V1** (Week 2)
   - Exploring how biological vision systems detect motion
   - Mapping computational elements to neural structures

3. **Core Motion Energy Model** (Week 3)
   - Implementing the complete Adelson & Bergen model
   - Understanding each component and their integration

4. **Extensions, Comparison & Application** (Week 4)
   - Connecting motion energy to broader research
   - Applying models to real-world problems

## Approach
The course emphasizes:
- Hands-on exercises in Python using Jupyter notebooks
- Visual intuition through interactive demonstrations
- Biological context alongside computational implementation
- Comparative understanding with other motion detection frameworks

## Prerequisites
- Basic Python programming
- Familiarity with NumPy, Matplotlib
- Undergraduate-level mathematics (calculus, linear algebra)
- Some background in neuroscience helpful but not required
