# Foundations: Visualizing Motion & Math Tools

## Overview
This module builds the mathematical and conceptual foundations needed to understand motion energy models. You'll develop intuition for how motion is represented in space-time and learn the essential signal processing tools that underlie motion detection.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Visualize motion patterns in the spatiotemporal domain
- Understand and implement basic spatial and temporal filters
- Apply convolution operations to signals and images
- Analyze signals using Fourier transforms
- Create and manipulate visual stimuli for motion perception
