    "In these exercises, you've implemented convolution operations from 1D to 3D and applied them to various signals and images. You've gained hands-on experience with a fundamental operation that is central to motion energy models.\n",

    "Key takeaways:\n",
    "- Convolution is a mathematical operation that combines two functions to produce a third function\n",
    "- In visual processing, convolution models how neurons with specific receptive fields respond to visual stimuli\n",
    "- 3D convolution extends this concept to include the time dimension, enabling motion detection\n",
    "- Optimization techniques like separable convolution can significantly improve computational efficiency\n",

    "In the next section, we'll explore the Fourier transform, which provides another powerful perspective on signal processing and motion analysis."
