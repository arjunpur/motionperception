    "## 1. Introduction to Spatiotemporal Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this course, we've been exploring visual stimuli in both space and time. Now, we'll bring these dimensions together in a unified framework: the spatiotemporal representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Spatiotemporal Representation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Spatiotemporal representation refers to a way of describing visual information that integrates both spatial coordinates (x, y) and time (t) into a single 3D space. In this framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each point (x, y, t) represents the intensity or color at a specific spatial location and time\n",
    "- A static image is a 2D slice of this space at a fixed time\n",
    "- A video is a 3D volume in this space\n",
    "- Motion appears as oriented structures in this space\n",
    "\n",
    "This representation is powerful because it allows us to see patterns and structures that might not be apparent when looking at individual frames or spatial slices."
