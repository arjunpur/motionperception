    "In these exercises, you'll explore spatiotemporal representations of visual stimuli and develop tools to analyze motion in the unified (x, y, t) space. This is a crucial conceptual framework for understanding motion energy models and how the visual system processes moving stimuli.\n",
    "\n",
    "These exercises will guide you through:\n",
    "- Creating 3D spatiotemporal stimuli representations\n",
    "- Visualizing and analyzing motion patterns in space-time\n",
    "- Extracting and interpreting spatiotemporal slices\n",
    "- Estimating velocity from spatiotemporal patterns\n",
    "- Building a simple motion detection mechanism using spatiotemporal properties\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In these exercises, you've explored spatiotemporal representations of visual stimuli and developed tools to analyze motion in the unified (x, y, t) space. You've learned how to create and visualize 3D stimuli, extract and interpret spatiotemporal slices, estimate velocity from spatiotemporal patterns, and build a simple motion detection mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key takeaways:\n",
    "- Motion can be represented as oriented patterns in the spatiotemporal domain\n",
    "- The orientation of these patterns is directly related to the velocity of motion\n",
    "- Space-time slices provide a powerful way to analyze motion\n",
    "- Direction-selective filters can be created by orienting filters in the spatiotemporal domain\n",
    "- The spatiotemporal representation forms the foundation for motion energy models\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts and skills will provide a strong foundation for understanding motion energy models, which we'll explore in detail in the next module. The spatiotemporal framework you've developed here bridges mathematics, computation, and biology, providing insight into how the visual system processes motion."
