- We are building a course on Motion Energy Models. We want this course to be very hands on- the student must implement a lot of the code. We want to gradually work the student up from the fundamentals to more advanced topics, emphasizing on drilling, learning by doing, and intuition into the mathematics. The course is all in motionenergy/. There is a README.md that describes the course in motionenergy/README.md. Currently only the 0_foundations section has some content fleshed out.
