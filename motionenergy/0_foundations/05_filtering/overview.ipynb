    "## 1. Introduction to Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "Filtering is the process of selectively enhancing or suppressing certain aspects of a signal. In visual processing, filters can be used to extract specific features from images or videos, such as edges, textures, or motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Filter?\n",
    "\n",
    "A filter is characterized by its impulse response (how it responds to a brief input pulse) or, equivalently, by its frequency response (how it affects different frequencies). Mathematically, filtering is implemented through convolution of the input signal with the filter's impulse response.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Filters\n",
    "\n",
    "Filters can be classified based on which frequencies they allow to pass through:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Low-pass filters**: Allow low frequencies and attenuate high frequencies\n",
    "- **High-pass filters**: Allow high frequencies and attenuate low frequencies\n",
    "- **Band-pass filters**: Allow a specific range of frequencies and attenuate others\n",
    "- **Band-stop filters**: Attenuate a specific range of frequencies and allow others\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's visualize some common filters and their effects on visual stimuli:"
