    "## 1. Key Concepts Review\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by reviewing the key concepts from each section of the foundations module:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Motion Energy Models\n",
    "- Motion energy models provide a computational framework for understanding how the brain processes visual motion\n",
    "- They are based on spatiotemporal filtering, quadrature pairs, energy computation, and opponent processing\n",
    "- Motion can be represented as oriented patterns in space-time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual Stimuli\n",
    "- Various specialized stimuli are used to study motion perception: drifting gratings, random dot kinematograms, moving bars, plaids\n",
    "- These stimuli allow precise control over motion parameters and isolate specific aspects of motion processing\n",
    "- Different stimuli have distinct representations in the spatiotemporal domain\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convolution\n",
    "- Convolution is a mathematical operation that combines two functions, typically an input signal and a filter\n",
    "- It is the foundation of filtering in signal processing\n",
    "- Convolution can be implemented in 1D, 2D, or higher dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fourier Transform\n",
    "- The Fourier Transform decomposes signals into their constituent frequencies\n",
    "- Visual stimuli can be represented in the spatial frequency domain and/or the temporal frequency domain\n",
    "- Motion has a specific signature in the spatiotemporal frequency domain\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filtering\n",
    "- Filters selectively enhance or suppress specific aspects of a signal\n",
    "- Common types include low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass filters\n",
    "- Gabor filters are particularly important for motion energy models due to their joint localization in space/time and frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spatiotemporal Representation\n",
    "- Visual information can be represented in a unified 3D space of (x, y, t)\n",
    "- This representation allows us to visualize motion as oriented structures\n",
    "- Different types of motion create different patterns in spatiotemporal space\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's explore how these concepts fit together to form the foundation of motion energy models."
